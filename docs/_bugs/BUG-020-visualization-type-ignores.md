# BUG-020: Visualization Module Type Safety Violations

## Priority
P3 (Medium) - Technical Debt

## Description
The `src/kalshi_research/analysis/visualization.py` module is riddled with `# type: ignore` comments. This suggests either:
1. The code is using libraries (matplotlib, pandas) in ways that violate their type stubs.
2. The code was generated by AI and forced to pass linting by suppressing errors rather than fixing them.

Key areas include `plot_probability_timeline` and `plot_spread_timeline` where list comprehensions and matplotlib calls are ignored.

## Location
- `src/kalshi_research/analysis/visualization.py`: Lines 68, 109, 110, 113, 114, 165, 212, 213, 215, 216.

## Impact
- **Brittleness:** Upgrading `matplotlib` or `numpy` could break this code silently.
- **Maintainability:** It is difficult to distinguish between "false positive" type errors and actual bugs.

## Proposed Fix
1. Remove `# type: ignore` and fix the underlying type mismatches.
2. Use proper casting (e.g., `cast(list[float], ...)`) if absolutely necessary.
3. Ensure `snapshots` input is correctly typed and validated before plotting.
