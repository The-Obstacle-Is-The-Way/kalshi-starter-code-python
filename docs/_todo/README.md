# TODO Index

This directory tracks **active tasks** (feature work, investigations, refactors) that are not bugs
(`docs/_bugs/`) and not technical debt items (`docs/_debt/`).

Blocked/deferred backlog items live in `docs/_future/` until they are ready to be pulled into active
work.

## Active Tasks

| ID | Title | Priority | Status |
