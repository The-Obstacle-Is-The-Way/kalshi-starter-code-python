# Archive (Historical)

This directory contains **archived** internal documentation (specs, bugs, and TODO audits).

Notes:

- Archived docs may reference **historical file paths** and behaviors that have since changed.
- The CLI previously lived in `src/kalshi_research/cli.py` and is now a package at
  `src/kalshi_research/cli/`.
- For current documentation, start at `docs/index.md` and `docs/developer/cli-reference.md`.
