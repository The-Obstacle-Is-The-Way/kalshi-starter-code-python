## Workflow

1. **New spec**: Create `SPEC-XXX-description.md` here
2. **Future work**: Move to `_future/` if deprioritized
3. **Implemented**: Move to `_archive/specs/`

## Archive (Implemented)

Completed specifications are stored under `docs/_archive/specs/` (excluded from the MkDocs site
build). See [`docs/_archive/README.md`](../_archive/README.md) for the archive structure.
