# Specifications (Active Implementation)

This directory contains **active** design specifications - work happening NOW.

## Distinction from `_future/`

| Directory | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `_specs/` | **Active implementation** | Work happening NOW |
| `_future/` | **Backlog** | Blocked, deferred, or planned later |

## Workflow

1. **New spec**: Create `SPEC-XXX-description.md` here
2. **Future work**: Move to `_future/` if deprioritized
3. **Implemented**: Move to `_archive/specs/`

## Archive (Implemented)

Completed specifications are stored under `docs/_archive/specs/` (excluded from the MkDocs site
build). See [`docs/_archive/README.md`](../_archive/README.md) for the archive structure.
